Due to the pandemic, I was unable to get much work done on my project. It is built in Visual Studio (programming) and run in Unity (testing)

The portfolio is my rendition of a "complex system". 
A complex system is used to describe a system where multiple agents communicate with each other to achieve a single goal.
They could be anything from Amazon delivery drones (so they don't collide with each other), cars (driverless) or even computer game ememies(so the player doesn't get swamped).
